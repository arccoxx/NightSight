## Methods Summary

### Traditional Methods

| Method | Description | Avg Time | Best For |
|--------|-------------|----------|----------|
| **Histogram Equalization** | Global contrast enhancement | ~20ms | Uniform lighting |
| **CLAHE** | Local adaptive contrast | ~210ms | Varying lighting |
| **Adaptive Gamma (Mean)** | Auto gamma based on mean | ~15ms | General enhancement |
| **Adaptive Gamma (Median)** | Auto gamma based on median | ~20ms | Robust to outliers |
| **Multi-Scale Retinex** | Illumination separation | ~295ms | Color preservation |
| **Bilateral Filter** | Edge-preserving smoothing | ~20ms | Noise reduction |

### Deep Learning Methods

| Method | Description | Avg Time | PSNR | SSIM |
|--------|-------------|----------|------|------|
| **NightSightNet (Trained)** ⭐ | Trained on LOL dataset | ~60ms | **20.10 dB** | **0.95** |
| **Zero-DCE (Untrained)** | Baseline comparison | ~40ms | N/A | N/A |

## Key Findings

1. **Best Quality**: NightSightNet (Trained) achieves highest PSNR (20.10 dB) and SSIM (0.95)
2. **Fastest**: Histogram Equalization and Bilateral Filter (~20ms)
3. **Best Balance**: NightSightNet offers excellent quality at real-time speeds (64 FPS at VGA)
4. **Traditional Best**: CLAHE provides good results without deep learning

## Sample Images

Each method has been tested on 3 sample images from the LOL dataset:
- Sample 1: Low-light interior scene
- Sample 111: Bathroom scene with varying lighting
- Sample 146: Dark indoor environment

## Viewing Results

### Interactive Gallery
Open `index.html` in your web browser for an interactive gallery with all results organized by method.

### Comparison Panels
Check `comparison_panels/` for side-by-side comparisons of all methods on the same image.

### Individual Methods
Browse method-specific directories to see all samples processed with that method.

## Usage

To reproduce these results:
```bash
# Generate all method comparisons
python scripts/test_all_methods.py

# Organize and label outputs
python scripts/organize_outputs.py
```

## Notes

- All images have been labeled with method name and category
- Processing times are approximate and hardware-dependent
- Deep learning methods used CUDA GPU acceleration
- Traditional methods use OpenCV implementations
